# Beginner's Guide: How to Enable XCB

XCB is an integral part of tinkering with PAXes. It is a modified ADB that allows the transfer of files and other data.

Setting it up is really easy, although commercial, locked PAXes may refuse to communicate.

## How to Enable XCB

First, shut down your PAX. When booting, repeatedly press the  `2`  keypad button (keep pressing even when the self-check is in progress). This will take you to the system menu. Find and open  **System Config**  (try the password  `123456`).

Once in  **System Config**, locate the XCB settings and open them. Select the appropriate methodâ€”wireless (when connected to Wi-Fi) is slower than wired through USB.

Once XCB is enabled, follow the setup instructions in the [main README](https://github.com/370network/pax-s920/blob/main/README.md) and test if XCB is working using the  `paxpush` command.
